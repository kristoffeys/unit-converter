# Unit Converter


In order to be able to use this unit converter, first install all the dependencies via [composer](https://getcomposer.org/):
```
composer install
```

After running composer install you should be good to go. There are 3 commands that can be used to do conversions. 

Converting distances:
```
bin/console unit-converter:distance
```

Converting temperatures:
```
bin/console unit-converter:temperature
```

Converting weights:
```
bin/console unit-converter:weight
```

After running any of these comments in the project directory. You'll get a CLI wizzard to do the conversions.
